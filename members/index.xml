The team studies methods of implementing engineering solutions for acquiring multimodal phenotypic data in crops, which can be used for assisting breeders and growers obtaining faster and more reliable data.
I have over 8 years of engineering experience in academia and industry. Before joining the University of Florida, I was a researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology - AIST (Tokyo, Japan), working on teaching by demonstration approaches for robot manipulation from September 2021 to January 2023.</description></item><item><title>Dylan Clark</title><link>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/dylan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/dylan/</guid><description>I am a new graduate student with a background in plant breeding and ecophysiology. I graduated with my B.S in Plant Science from the University of Florida and have worked for UF in some capacity for the past 4 years. Most of my previous work revolved around heat tolerance and drought tolerance in crops and natural ecosystems. My most notable project was the developement of a high-throughput system for measuring thermal-tolerance in breeding programs and natural ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>Felix Enciso-Rodriguez</title><link>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/felix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/felix/</guid><description>I am a biologist with wide-ranging experience in bioinformatics and molecular approaches for gene identification, gene mapping, and molecular characterization of germplasm collections from orphan and cultivated crops. I have implemented genomic selection strategies as well as genome editing approaches in staple crops such as potatoes (resulting in two patents) and blueberries. The combination of such techniques, along with germplasm characterization and gene discovery, has allowed me to contribute to accelerating the generation of new potato varieties and exploiting heterosis in advanced breeding lines.</description></item><item><title>Hemanth Pedamallu</title><link>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/hemanth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/hemanth/</guid><description>I am a dedicated and results-driven computer science student with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology to solve real-world problems. My commitment to research is reflected in my publication on VoIP Spam Detection using Machine Learning in IEEE&amp;rsquo;s prestigious digital library. This publication underscores my dedication to advancing knowledge in the field. Beyond the technical realm, I am passionate about enhancing websites, both in terms of user interfaces and APIs.</description></item><item><title>TJ Schultz</title><link>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/tj/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://team.fruitphenomics.net/members/tj/</guid><description>I hold a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and an A.S. in Programming and Analysis. I am currently employed at the University of Florida Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Lab, writing code for automated phenotyping projects. I have experience with building web pages, object-oriented programs with GUI elements, databases using SQL, mathematical modeling programs, machine/deep learning applications, and computer vision applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
